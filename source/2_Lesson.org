- Transistors can come in many shapes and sizes.
[[https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/0e/Transistors-white.jpg]]
- They all have something in common - three pins.
- The transistors we find in computer chips and memory are much smaller - 22nm to be exact which is 0.000000022m
[[file:img/22nm.jpg]]
- The circuit diagram for a transistor is shown below, with the three pins labeled =B= for Base, =C= for Collector and =E= for Emitter.

#+END_HTML
- As mentioned in the previous lesson, a transistor can act like a switch. When there is current entering the Base(=B=) of the transistor, current is allowed to flow through the Collector(=C=) to the Emitter(=E=).

- Have a play with the transistor below so you understand how applying a voltage to the base of a transistor is equivalent to turning on a switch.

- We can combine transistors to make some pretty useful things. One combination of transistors is known as a NAND gate.
- A NAND gate is made from two transistors combined as shown below.
#+BEGIN_HTML
<object data="js/TranNANDstatic.html" width='300px' height='320px'></object>
#+END_HTML
- The basic concept of this arrangement, is that if current *can't* flow through the collector and base of *both* resistors to /Earth/, then instead it will flow through the /OUT/
- If both transistors allow current through their /Collector/ and /Emitter/, then no current will flow through /OUT/
- Have a play with the arrangement below and make sure you understand how the NAND gate works.

- Below is a table showing the states that A and B can have, with a column left blank for the OUT (which has been labeled Q). This is called a *Truth Table*.
| A | B | Q |
|---+---+---|
| 0 | 0 |   |
| 1 | 0 |   |
| 0 | 1 |   |
| 1 | 1 |   | 
- Copy the table and complete the column labeled Q. (An input or output is /ON/ (=1=), if it current is flowing through it (red)
- Now copy and fill in the missing spaces in the description below.
#+BEGIN_QUOTE
_NAND GATES_

NAND gates have two inputs (A and B) and an output (___). When A and B are both ____, then Q is ____. If either A or B are ____ then Q is ____. If A and B are both ____ then Q is ____.

- There is another arrangement of transistors that can produce a table as shown below.
| A | B | Q |
|---+---+---|
| 0 | 0 | 0 |
| 1 | 0 | 1 |
| 0 | 1 | 1 |
| 1 | 1 | 1 | 
- Using any graphics package on your computer, try to draw the arrangement of transistors that would produce a table like this.
